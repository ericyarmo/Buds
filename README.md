2. **[`CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md`](./docs/CANONICALIZATION_SPEC.md)** - Receipt signing (CRITICAL)
   - **Must read carefully** - Defines exact bytes signed/hashed
   - Unsigned preimage pattern avoids CID/signature circularity
   - Strongly-typed payloads with `claimed_time_ms`

3. **[`DATABASE_SCHEMA.md`](./docs/DATABASE_SCHEMA.md)** - GRDB schema
   - Skim tables, understand `ucr_headers` vs `local_receipts`

   - Device registration, message delivery

10. **[`DISPENSARY_INSIGHTS.md`](./docs/DISPENSARY_INSIGHTS.md)** - B2B product
    - Deals-based revenue model ($99-599/month tiers)
    - K-anonymity threshold (n≥75)

## Architecture Highlights

### Causality-First Receipt Architecture
Every event is a signed, content-addressed receipt (UCRHeader):
```swift
struct UCRHeader {
    let cid: String                    // CIDv1 (dag-cbor, sha2-256)
    let did: String                    // Author DID
    let parentCID: String?             // Edit chain parent (CAUSAL TRUTH)
    let rootCID: String                // First version in chain
    let receiptType: String            // app.buds.session.created/v1
    let payload: ReceiptPayload        // Strongly-typed (contains claimed_time_ms)
    let signature: String              // Ed25519 (base64)
    // NO timestamp! Time is in payload as claimed_time_ms (author's claim, not truth)
}
```

**Key principle:** Causality (parentCID chains) = verifiable truth. Time (claimed_time_ms) = unverifiable claim.

### Local-First Storage
- **GRDB (SQLite)** for local persistence
- **Optimistic updates** (UI updates immediately, sync background)
- **Offline-first** (full functionality without network)

### E2EE Circle Sharing
- **X25519 key agreement** for key wrapping
- **AES-256-GCM** for payload encryption
- **Device-based keys** (multi-device support)
- **Max 12 members** (manageable key distribution)

### Privacy by Default
- **Location OFF** by default
- **Fuzzy locations** for Circle sharing (~500m grid)
- **Explicit consent** for every share
- **E2EE relay** (server sees only ciphertext)

## Key Architectural Fixes

✅ **Causality-first** - parentCID chains = truth, time = claim (in payload as claimed_time_ms)
✅ **CID/signature circularity** - Unsigned preimage pattern avoids circular dependency
✅ **Deterministic CBOR** - Strongly-typed payloads, sorted keys, Int64 timestamps
✅ **Device vs DID** - Multi-device model with per-device key wrapping
✅ **Append-only** - Edits create new receipts, deletions create tombstones (no mutations)

---

## Contributing

This is a private project (for now). Architecture by Claude (Anthropic) + Eric. Vaksman will be coming soon...

---

## Security

**Threat model:** See [`PRIVACY_ARCHITECTURE.md`](./docs/PRIVACY_ARCHITECTURE.md)

**Key principles:**
- E2EE for Circle sharing
- Local-first (data never leaves device unless shared)
- Relay server is untrusted (sees only ciphertext)
- **No PII in receipts**: Phone numbers live only in Firebase Auth layer; receipts never include phone/email/name. Circle uses local nicknames (displayName) stored only on your device. DIDs are derived from cryptographic keys, not personal identifiers.

## Legal

**Age:** 21+ only (federally illegal in US)
**Disclaimer:** No medical advice, no sales facilitation
**Privacy:** Designed for GDPR/CCPA compliance; export/delete/portability planned in v0.2+

### Phase 6: E2EE Sharing + Cloudflare Relay (NEXT UP - Critical)

**⚠️ HIGH COMPLEXITY: E2EE streams for <12 people with offline ownership**

**Focus:** Transform Circle from UI-only to functional E2EE sharing with Cloudflare Workers relay

**Critical Components:**
- [ ] **Cloudflare Workers** - TypeScript relay API (~440 lines)
  - Device registration endpoint
  - Phone → DID lookup (SHA-256 hashed)
  - Message send/receive with D1 storage
  - Firebase Auth token verification
- [ ] **Device Management** - Multi-device registration + discovery
  - Device ID generation on first launch
  - X25519 + Ed25519 keypair storage
  - Register with Cloudflare on sign-in
- [ ] **E2EE Encryption** - Hybrid encryption primitives
  - X25519 key agreement (ECDH)
  - AES-256-GCM payload encryption
  - Per-message ephemeral AES keys
  - Multi-device key wrapping
- [ ] **Share Flow** - Memory sharing UI + logic
  - "Share to Circle" UI (member selection)
  - Encrypt raw CBOR receipt
  - POST to Workers relay
  - Recipient inbox polling
- [ ] **Offline Ownership** - Local-first data model
  - Receipts stored locally (sender copy)
  - Shared receipts encrypted at rest
  - Sync conflict resolution strategy
  - Receipt ownership verification

**Architecture Challenges:**
- Multi-device E2EE key distribution
- Offline message queueing
- Conflict-free replicated data (CRDTs?)
- Key rotation without breaking shares
- Device revocation handling

**See [`PHASE_6_PLAN.md`](./PHASE_6_PLAN.md) for implementation guide.**

### Future Phases
- [ ] **Phase 7:** Message Inbox + Push Notifications + Background Sync
- [ ] **Phase 8:** Map View + Fuzzy Location Privacy
- [ ] **Phase 9:** Agent Integration (DeepSeek/Qwen)
- [ ] **Phase 10:** Polish + TestFlight v2

**Current file count:** 35 Swift files + 6 docs = Ready for E2EE relay

**December 20, 2025: Phase 5 complete! Circle mechanics ready. Phase 6 next: E2EE sharing infrastructure. 🔐🌿**
